# Asok75
A 75% keyboard PCB.

A simple [acrylic case](Case) has also been designed - .dxf files are in the Case folder in the repository.

This PCB is designed to work with [QMK firmware](https://github.com/asok3781/qmk_firmware/tree/asok/keyboards/asok/asok75) (firmware is in my branch of the QMK firmware in the expected location).

A [VIA definition](asok75VIAdefinition) has also been created to be able to customise the layout of the keyboard easily.
