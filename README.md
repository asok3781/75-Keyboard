# Asok75
A PCB designed to fit in TX Keyboard's TX75v2 using the ATMega32U4 MCU, designed to be compatible with QMK firmware.

A laser-cut acrylic case has also been designed to accompany this PCB, consisting of .dxf files, in the case folder. 

Note the case is only compatible with the v1 PCB. The newer PCB's dimensions have been changed
